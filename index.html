               <p>Gordo was one of the first monkeys to make it into space as 
               part of NASA's space program. Eight monkeys had flown on NASA 
               missions before him, five of whom went by the name of Albert.</p>

               <p>Gordo's historic flight took place on December 13, 1958 when 
                he took off from Cape Canaveral for a 15 minute flight into 
                space. Even though he was weightless for over 8 minutes the 
                on-board instruments indicated that Gordo enjoyed his journey 
                into space. Scientists monitoring the flight were pleased to 
                note that the only slight side effect Gordo suffered from the 
                entry into space was a modest slowing of his pulse.</p>
                
                <h3>The Mission</h3>

                <p>The rocket carrying Gordo into space would take off from the 
                Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral, travel further than 
                any monkey had ever travelled before - over 1,500 miles - and 
                reach a height of 310 miles (500 km) before returning to Earth 
                and landing in the South Atlantic, 1,302 nautical miles south of
                Cape Canaveral.</p>

                monkey up first. Well, none of us wants to think that they're 
                gonna send a monkey up to do a man's work ... what they're 
                trying to do to us is send a man up to do a monkey's work.</q><cite>

                <h4>The Jupiter AM-13</h4>

                <p>The Jupiter IRBM <em>(Intermediate Range Ballistic 
                Missile)</em> was originally developed by the US Army as a 
                long-range successor to its PGM-11 Redstone missile, but was 
                eventually taken over and deployed by the USAF for political 
                reasons. It was also the only one of the United States' early 
                stategic ballistic missiles with some mobility.</p>

                <p>Gordo wore a specially customised space suit custom made for 
                a monkey about one foot tall. The space suit was fitted with 
                instruments, including temperature meters and microphones which 
                recorded his historic suborbital journey, considered one of the 
                outstanding achievements of space research.</p>
